## [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms)

- Graph search
  - [x] [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property)
  - [x] [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.)
  - [ ] A*
  - [x] [Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) (is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph)
  - [ ] [Floyd-Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) (is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).)
  - [ ] [Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) (is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.)
